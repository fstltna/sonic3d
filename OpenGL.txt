Solution: Choose the 32 bit renderer in the starting setup screen.

2.Video card driver needs to be updated. Very common for Radeon owners.
Solution: update the video card driver.

3.The machine is Outdated. It also very common for netbook/notebook users.
Solution: Sadly, there's no solution for this problem. Try to play the game on another machine.
